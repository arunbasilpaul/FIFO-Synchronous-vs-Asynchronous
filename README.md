# FIFO-Synchronous-vs-Asynchronous
This project explores the simplicity/complexity of a synchronous and asynchronous FIFO. FIFO is a valuable component during data transmission, in particular during clock-domain crossing for multi-bit data. Therefore, we dive it into designing a synchronous and asynchronous FIFO to compare their similarities and differences.
